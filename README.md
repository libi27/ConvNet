Main features:
- Everything is implemented in Matlab. No mex files, no complication,
  is needed.
- If you have the Matlab parallel toolbox, you can use GPU implementation
  by just defining one flag: atGPU = true;
- The implementation has simplicity in mind, but it is still
  reasonably fast.
- See demoMNIST for a simple use.
